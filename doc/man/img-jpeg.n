.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The package \fBimg::jpeg\fR is a sub-package of
\fBImg\fR. It can be loaded as a part of the complete Img support,
via \fBpackage require Img\fR, or on its own, via
\fBpackage require img::jpeg\fR.
.PP
Like all packages of \fBImg\fR it does \fInot\fR provide new
commands, but extends the existing \fBTk\fR command \fBimage\fR so
that it supports files containing raster images in the
Joint Picture Expert Group format (jpeg). More specifically
\fBimg::jpeg\fR extends \fBTk\fR's \fBphoto\fR
image type.
.PP
The name of the new format handler is \fBjpeg\fR.
This handler provides new additional configuration options. See
section \fBJPEG OPTIONS\fR for more detailed explanations.

.PP
All of the above means that in a call like
.TP
\fBimage\fR \fBcreate photo\fR ?\fIname\fR? ?\fIoptions\fR?\fR
.IP [1]
Image data in jpeg format (options \fB-data\fR and \fB-file\fR) is
detected automatically.
.IP [2]
The format name \fBjpeg\fR is recognized by the option \fB-format\fR.
In addition the value for the option is treated as list and may
contain any of the special options listed in section
\fBJPEG OPTIONS\fR.
.SH "JPEG OPTIONS"
The handler provides six options, two effective when reading from a
JPEG image, and five influencing the writing of such. One option is
usable for both reading an writing.
.TP
\fB-fast\fR
This option is for reading from JPEG data. It usage activates a
processing mode which is fast, but also provides only low-quality
information.
.TP
\fB-grayscale\fR
This option can be used for both reading and writing of JPEG
data. Usage of this option forces incoming images to grayscale, and
written images will be monochrome.
.TP
\fB-quality\fR \fIn\fR
This option is for writing JPEG data. It specifies the compression
level as a quality percentage. The higher the quality, the less the
compression. The nominal range for \fIn\fR is
\fB0\fR...\fB100\fR. Useful values are in the range
\fB5\fR...\fB95\fR. The default value is \fB75\fR.
.TP
\fB-smooth\fR \fIn\fR
This option is for writing JPEG data. When used the writer will smooth
the image before performing the compression. Values in the
\fB10\fR...\fB30\fR are usually enough. The default is \fB0\fR,
i.e no smoothing.
.TP
\fB-optimize\fR
This option is for writing JPEG data. It usage causes the writer to
optimize the huffman table used to encode the jpeg coefficients.
.TP
\fB-progressive\fR
This option is for writing JPEG data. It usage causes the creation of
a \fIprogressive\fR JPEG file.
